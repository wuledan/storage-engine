// Wake-up strategy:
//   - unlock():       exclusive lock released. Try to wake waiters.
//   - unlock_shared(): shared lock released. If last reader and writer
//                      waiting, try to wake waiters.
//   - wake_waiters(): atomically drain the waiter stack. If the top waiter
//                      is a writer, wake just that writer (exclusive).
//                      If the top waiter is a reader, wake all consecutive
//                      readers from the stack top (batch wake) until a
//                      writer is encountered, then stop (writer blocks
//                      further reader wakes for fairness).
//   - Remaining waiters are re-pushed via CAS (merging with new arrivals).
